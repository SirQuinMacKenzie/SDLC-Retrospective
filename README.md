For my future development projects, whether for college assignments or as part of a development team, the Scrum-agile processes of communication are by far the most important to carry and implement into everyday use.
Maintaining the trust and teamwork of open communication and planning is what makes a good team amazing, and is the general backbone of all agile practices.
With that in mind, the limitaions of agile need to be recognized and accounted for depending on the needs of the project/team. Moving forward, I hope to use what I learned here to adapt my development style to what
best fits the situation at hand. I feel I learned alot about the actual practice of software development, such as utilizing/creating user stories to help narrow down the focus of the project while also defining what
constitutes success in the project. It implements user needs and feedback into the development cycle and needs to be a constant concern for me as I aim to make usable and useful code/software.
